9. Selection sort is based on the following idea: Selecting the largest array element and swapping it with the last array element leaves an unsorted list whose size is 1 less than the size of the original list. If we repeat this step again on the unsorted list we will have an ordered list of size 2 and an unordered list size n–2 . When we repeat this until the size of the unsorted list becomes one, the result will be a sorted list. Write a program to implement this algorithm.

10. Develop a program to implement the binary search algorithm. This technique compares the search key value with the value of the element that is midway in a “sorted” list. Then;
```

(b) If the search key value is less than the middle value, then the first half of the list contains the key value.
(c) If the search key value is greater than the middle value, then the second half contains the key value.
```
Repeat this “divide-and-conquer” strategy until we have a match. If the list is reduced to one nonmatching element, then the list does not contain the key value.
Use the sorted list created in Exercise 8.9 or use any other sorted list.

7. Write a program that requests for a file name and
an integer, known as offset value. The program then
reads the file starting from the location specified by
the offset value and prints the contents on the
screen.
Note: If the offset value is a positive integer, then
printing skips that many lines. If it is a negative
number, it prints that many lines from the end of
the file. An appropriate error message should be
printed, if anything goes wrong.

8. Write a program to create a sequential file that
could store details about five products. Details
include product code, cost and number of items
available and are provided through keyboard.
- [sharafat](solutions/sharafat/13/8.c)

9. Write a program to read the file
created in Exercise 13.8 and compute and print the
total value of all the five products.
- [sharafat](solutions/sharafat/13/9.c)

10. Rewrite the program developed in Exercise 13.8 to
store the details in a random access file and print
the details of alternate products from the file.
Modify the program so that it can output the details
of a product when its code is specified interactively.

11. Write a C program that uses file
handling methods to store records of mixed data in
a file.
- [sharafat](solutions/sharafat/13/11.c)

12. Write a C program that uses getw function to read
integer values from one file. Subsequently, it uses
the putw function to write the integer values in
reverse order in another file.

13. Write a C program that reads characters from a file
and prints their ASCII codes.
- [sharafat](solutions/sharafat/13/13.c)

14. Write a C program that concatenates the contents
of two files and writes then in the third file.
- [sharafat](solutions/sharafat/13/14.c)

15. Write a C program that uses fscanf
function to read integer values from a file, computes
the square of each integer value and places the
resultant values in a different file.

## Chapter 14 

1. In Worked-Out Problem 14.4, we have used print()
in recursive mode. Rewrite this function using
iterative technique in for loop.

2. Write a menu driven program to create a linked list
of a class of students and perform the following
operations:
(a) Write out the contents of the list.
(b) Edit the details of a specified student.
(c) Count the number of students above a specified
age and weight.
Make use of the header file defined in Review
Question 14.8.
- [Pasquale](solutions/Pasquale/14/2.c)

3. Write recursive and non-recursive functions for
reversing the elements in a linear list. Compare the
relative efficiencies of them.

4. Write an interactive program to create linear linked
lists of customer names and their telephone
numbers. The program should be menu driven and
include features for add ing a new customer and
deleting an existing customer.
- [Pasquale](solutions/Pasquale/14/4.c)

5. Modify the above program so that the list is always
maintained in the alphabetical order of customer
names.
- [Pasquale](solutions/Pasquale/14/5.c)

6. Develop a program to combine two sorted lists to
produce a third sorted lists which contains one
occurrence of each of the elements in the original
lists.

7. Write a program to create a circular linked list so
that the input order of data item is maintained. Add
function to carry out the following operations on
circular linked list.
a. Count the number of nodes
b. Write out contents
c. Locate and write the contents of a given node

8. Write a program to construct an ordered doubly
linked list and write out the contents of a specified
node.

9. Write a function that would traverse a linear singly
linked list in reverse and write out the contents in
reverse order.

10. Given two ordered singly linked lists, write a
function that will merge them into a third ordered
list.
- [Pasquale](solutions/Pasquale/14/10.c)

11. Write a function that takes a pointer to the first
node in a linked list as a parameter and returns a
pointer to the last node. NULL should be returned if
the list is empty.
- [Pasquale](solutions/Pasquale/14/11.c)

12. Write a function that counts and returns the total
number of nodes in a linked list.
- [Pasquale](solutions/Pasquale/14/12.c)

13. Write a function that takes a specified node of a
linked list and makes it as its last node.

14. Write a function that computers and
returns the length of a circular list.

15. Write functions to implement the following tasks
for a doubly linked list.
a. To insert a node.
b. To delete a node.
c. To find a specified node.

## Chapter 15 

1. Define a macro PRINT_VALUE that can be used to
print two values of arbitrary type.

2. Write a nested macro that gives the minimum of
three values.

3. Define a macro with one parameter to compute the
volume of a sphere. Write a program using this
macro to compute the volume for spheres of radius
5, 10 and 15 metres.

4. Define a macro that receives an array and the
number of elements in the array as arguments. Write
a program using this macro to print out the elements
of an array.

5. Using the macro defined in the exercise 15.4, write a
program to compute the sum of all elements in an
array.

6. Write symbolic constants for the binary arithmetic
operators +, –, * and /. Write a short program to
illustrate the use of these symbolic constants.

7. Define symbolic constants for { and }
and printing a blank line. Write a small program
using these constants.

8. Write a program to illustrate the use of stringizing
operator.

9. Write a simple C program to demonstrate how a
user-created file in included in a C program.

10. Write a C program that uses the
#error directive to stop the program execution when
an error is encountered.

11. Write a C program that uses macro substitution to
compute the area of a rectangle.

12. Write a C program to implement a macro named
NOTEQUAL that performs logical not operation.
